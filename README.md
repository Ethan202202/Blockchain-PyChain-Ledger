# Build a blockchain-based ledger system
### This system allows users to save senders, receivers and amount and then verify the integrity of their data. 
## Step 1: Create a Record Data Class
### Define a new Python data class named Record. Give this new class a formalized data structure that consists of the sender, receiver, and amount attributes.
## Step 2: Modify the Existing Block Data Class to Store Record Data
### Rename the data attribute in the Block class to record, and then set it to use an instance of the new Record class.
## Step 3: Add Relevant User Inputs to the Streamlit Interface
### Add additional input areas for the user interface of Streamlit application. Create these input areas to capture the sender, receiver, and amount for each transaction.
## Step 4: Test the PyChain Ledger by Storing Records
### Using it to store all the transactions.
